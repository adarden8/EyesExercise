# EyesExercise
## Week 8: MITxPro Full Stack Development with MERN

### Description 
The objective of this project was to create two eyes which would "follow" the users cursor around the webpage. This was done using multiple divs for the eye images and practicing with the grid. 

### How to Run
This code can be forked and downloaded for personal use or can be viewed at adarden8.github.io/EyesExercise/. 

### Future Improvements
I'd like to see if I could add an on or off function to the eyes maybe as an "on-click" event. Additionally, it might be interesting if the user could add multiple eyes to the page instead of constantly having just the two eyes.
